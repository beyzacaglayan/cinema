3 regions I created named properties, constructor and methods; I defined the buttons that will show the hall names, number of seats and number of empty seats. In this way, it will be able
to show us the total balance and the number of remaining empty seats as a result of the transaction.

We can create a hall by entering the hall name and the total number of seats in the hall. Every time we press 'Sell Tickets' it sells one full ticket. When we tick the 'discounted' box below,
the price becomes -10 lira. By clicking on the boxes on the side, it shows the current number of seats and the total balance after the total ticket sales.
When we return the ticket, the hall deducts 5 lira from the price.
